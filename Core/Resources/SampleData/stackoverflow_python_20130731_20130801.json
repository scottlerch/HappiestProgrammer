{"DataSource":"stackoverflow.com","CommentId":"26250836","Text":"When I say 2D here, I mean number of dimensions in the numpy array and not in a mathematical sense. With that definition in mind, shape <code>(3,)</code> is 1D and shape <code>(1, 3)</code> is 2D, which is why you need to convert <code>e2vec</code> only.","Language":"python"}
{"DataSource":"stackoverflow.com","CommentId":"26250599","Text":"A minor semantic ambiguity, but I see your point.  In the strict Unix sense, it&#39;s a text file.  But it&#39;s not a &quot;.txt&quot; text file.","Language":"python"}

Of course, as you mention the issue is about the <b>format</b> of the text in the RTF file that differs from a plain ol&#39; TXT file.","Language":"python"}
{"DataSource":"stackoverflow.com","CommentId":"26250096","Text":"The one with shape <code>(3,)</code> isn&#39;t 1x3 any more than the 2-d one is 1x3x3. Numpy arrays support any number of dimensions (even 0!); <code>dot</code> is only dot product for 1-dimensional arrays.","Language":"python"}
