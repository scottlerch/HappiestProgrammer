Anyway, if you are sure that the <code>CubeClick</code> method will be assigned always only to the <code>TCube</code> objects, you may use direct typecast by <code>Cube := TCube(Sender);</code>. The <code>as</code> operator (<code>Sender as TCube</code>) is safer in that it <i>tries to typecast</i> object to the desired type and if that&#39;s not possible, it raises an exception about it, whilst with direct typecasting (<code>TCube(Sender)</code>) you&#39;re expecting just the object (<code>Sender</code>) will be of that desired type (but it&#39;s bad if it&#39;s not of that type).","Language":"delphi"},{"DataSource":"stackoverflow.com","CommentId":"26261896","Text":"You want the name, don&#39;t you?
